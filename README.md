# Fire-alarm-system
A system uses an LM35 temperature sensor and a smoke sensor to detect fire emergencies, then unlocks the door, activates a water pump, buzzer, and red LED. It returns to normal when the owner enters the correct password (stored on an EEPROM and changeable) and the sensors read normal levels.
